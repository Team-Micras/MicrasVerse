Physics:
- Model a DC motor
- Transfer movement constraints to a Wheel class
- Model LEDs
- Model Dip Switch

Graphics:
- Move GUI to a class of itself
- Include lighting effects to represent LEDs
- Be able to render text inside the maze (mostly numbers for the cost of each cell)

General:
- Make possible to load a different maze from file (and through GUI)
- Create a "known" maze to represent what micras currently knows about the maze
- Integrate with MicrasController (might need an interface)
