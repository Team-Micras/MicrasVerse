
Physics:
- Fix where the wheels are
- Fix where the distance sensors are
- Model LEDs
- Transfer movement constraints to a Wheel class â†’ still thinking about this

Graphics:
- Be able to render text inside the maze (mostly numbers for the cost of each cell)
- Include lighting effects to represent LEDs

General:
- Change screen to a scene that contain scene elements, in a way the the scene can access&modify the scene elements through GUI
- Make possible to load a different maze from file (and through GUI)
- Create a "known" maze to represent what micras currently knows about the maze
- Integrate with MicrasController (need proxies' interface)
