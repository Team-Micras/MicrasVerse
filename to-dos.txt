Physics:
- Model LEDs
- Model Dip Switch
- Transfer movement constraints to a Wheel class â†’ still thinking about this

Graphics:
- Include lighting effects to represent LEDs
- Be able to render text inside the maze (mostly numbers for the cost of each cell)

General:
- Make possible to load a different maze from file (and through GUI)
- Create a "known" maze to represent what micras currently knows about the maze
- Integrate with MicrasController (might need an interface)
